    <h3 class="tera push-1-4">The Goal</h3>
    <p itemscope itemprop="description" class="kilo push-0">This project had myself and my team create a brand and working prototype for an HR App based around ones first day of work at a new job.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Planning</h3>
    <p class="kilo push-0">The Planning of this app revolved around finding ways to simplify the “first day” process, in turn reducing turnover and improving employee satisfaction for businesses subscribed to the First Day Kit. We decided the best way to do so was to create a portal for new employees to use to transition smoothly into their new place of work. The portal then created around the idea that a new employee could sign in and get all the information to integrate into their new work enviroment in one place, using things like a work calender or any resources they need.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Production</h3>
    <p class="kilo push-0">Production began with the creation of the branding. We picked a logo and style for the brand, and once that was established, began creating the prototype. To work as a team we simply created a backlog with individual tasks (for example, “write content for the “people” page), which were then assigned to team members. This helped us stay organized and on track.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Final Product</h3>
    <p class="kilo">This process left us with a highly functional, high fidelity prototype of the FDK portal, as well as a branding guideline for future use.</p>
