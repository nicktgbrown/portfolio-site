  <p class="kilo push-0">The goal of this project was to create a branding guide for an optometry company. The goal was to create a brand that reflected the business as a local, small town company. A logo, stationary, cards, and web mock-up were created around the band.</p>
  <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Planning</h3>
  <p class="kilo push-0">The planning of this project involved assessing the target audience of this business, it’s already existent clientele, and it’s goals and ideals. Following Research, many sketches with many phases and iterations were created to get a direction for the logo that would become a key element in future deliverables.</p>
  <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Production</h3>
  <p class="kilo push-0">Production for this project involved creating all the deliverables previously mentioned. Once a logo was finalized, other elements were created around the established logo and colour scheme. After these elements were created and finalized, the branding guide was built around these elements, with rules for use of the logo, use of colour, typography, etc. Web mock-ups for potential sites (both desktop and mobile versions) were created using these guidelines and rules.</p>
  <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Final Product</h3>
  <p class="kilo">The final version of this product, included the logo, deliverable assets such as business cards and stationary. A branding guide was also finalized for use of the brands assets. The web and mobile mock-ups were then created for a potential web presence of this brand.</p>
