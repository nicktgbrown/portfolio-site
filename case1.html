    <h3 class="tera push-1-4">The Goal</h3>
    <p class="kilo push-0">The goal of this project was to integrate newly learnt UX skills with Web design. We were meant to extablish working prototypes of a fully responsive site, and then code it using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Planning</h3>
    <p class="kilo push-0">The early planning of this project involved many steps. Firstly, the major tasks and needs of the users had to be established, as well as potential personas for users of this site. By establishing these, research of competitors or similar sites began. After this began the early beginnings of prototypes in the form of sketches.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Production</h3>
    <p class="kilo push-0">Following the preliminary research and planning, I began creating the prototype in Adobe Xd. After completing a functioning prototype, with versions for mobile and desktop, some user testing was done to refine the usability of the site. While this was done, elements were created that would later be used when coding the site. Colour palettes and font styles were also established. After this was completed, coding began.</p>
    <h3 class="peta pad-t push-1-4">Final Product</h3>
    <p class="kilo">The final product consisted of a fully responsive faux SAAS website that promoted usability and functionality via the UX skills put to use and intent to design for accessibility.</p>
