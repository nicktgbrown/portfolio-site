Hi! My names Nick Brown, an Ottawa based graphic designer with a passion for web design, UX and Illustration.
I grew up drawing the days away, so Graphic Design was the dream career for a kid who loved to create! Now I'm able to constantly create, think about new solutions to unique problems, and constantly grow as a designer. The idea of always having something new to work on and ideas to work with is what keeps me passionate about design, and I can't wait to keep doing just that!
