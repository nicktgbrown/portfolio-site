Hey there! I'm Nick, Ottawa based, but locally grown. I've been known to design things, and tend to really enjoy it. You can catch me normally working with websites and UX design, but I also love being creative through illustration and motion graphics.
I spent my earliest years with a pencil at hand, so Graphic Design was the smartest move for a kid who loved to create. Design allows me to create, think about new solutions to unique problems, and constantly learn. The idea of always having something new to learn and ideas to work with is what keeps me passionate about design, and I can't wait to keep doing just that.
I spend most of my freetime doodling, playing old video games, or enjoying the outdoors. My passions revolve learning new skills, finding out how things work, and enjoying the smaller things, whether that be a quick hike or a nice plate of sushi.
